  <h1>2016 in figures</h1>
  <p>26 human beings and one bot, crunching hundreds of thousands of lines of code and working with scores of organisations around the world.</p>
  <p>It’s not <em>all</em> about the numbers, but they do give a good overview.</p>

        Every time we press the button marked ‘commit’, we’re making changes and additions to our code. This figure’s wildly up on last year’s (15,723) because of the diligent little EveryPolitician Bot. About which, more later.

  <p>We wish we could work with every single one of the organisations who applied for our development help. Sadly, there are only so many hours in the day. Until that changes, our vibrant <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/subscribe/">online communities and message groups</a> are there to give you support.</p>
