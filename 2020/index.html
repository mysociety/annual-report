                <h2>It's been a year like no other</h2>
                <p>Yup, that's hardly an original thought.</p>
                <p>Fortunately for us, mySociety's Annual Report comes out before everyone else's, so we can get in
                    first with the clich&eacute;s. Yes, these are <em>unprecedented times</em>. The pandemic <em>wrought
                        havoc</em> and plunged us into a <em>new normal</em>. </p>
                <p>There have been upheavals, disruptions to our plans. Travel disallowed; face to face meetings largely
                    a thing of the past &mdash; the biggest work-related disappointment of lockdown, for us, was the
                    cancellation of our Reykjavik TICTeC conference.</p>
                <p>There again, in many ways we have been fortunate. We've experienced little operational disturbance,
                    since we've always been a remote organisation where everyone works from home. Whilst we've all felt
                    the stress of the pandemic over the last few months, it's possible we've been <em>more</em>
                    productive than usual without the interruption of travel.</p>
                <p>And so, our big changes this year? Well, they have nothing to do with COVID and everything to do with
                    our core mission as an organisation: <strong>helping people be active citizens</strong>.</p>

            24th–25th March</p>
        <p>We'd planned our annual <a href="https://tictec.mysociety.org/" class="white-link">Impacts of Civic Tech conference</a> as usual: we'd have been convening in Reykjavik, reconnecting with friends old and new from around the world.</p>
        <p>In March. And we all know what happened to March.</p>
        <p>And so, it was a quick turnaround time: as with so many in-person events, large and small, <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/2020/03/31/tictec-goes-virtual-running-a-large-scale-international-conference-online/" class="white-link">we had to take it online</a> (in just ten days!). We still heard from a range of knowledgeable and inspiring speakers… but they were presenting from their own homes rather than the TICTeC podium. Around 250 people from over 30 different countries attended; and speakers hailed from all continents across the world.</p>
