                <h2>It's been a year like no other</h2>
                <p>Yup, that's hardly an original thought.</p>
                <p>Fortunately for us, mySociety's Annual Report comes out before everyone else's, so we can get in first with the clich&eacute;s. Yes, these are <em>unprecedented times</em>. The pandemic <em>wrought havoc</em> and plunged us into a <em>new normal</em>. </p>
                <p>There have been upheavals, disruptions to our plans. Travel disallowed; face to face meetings largely a thing of the past &mdash; the biggest work-related disappointment of lockdown, for us, was the cancellation of our Reykjavik TICTeC conference.</p>
                <p>There again, in many ways we have been fortunate. We've experienced little operational disturbance, since we've always been a remote organisation where everyone works from home. Whilst we've all felt the stress of the pandemic over the last few months, it's possible we've been <em>more</em> productive than usual without the interruption of travel.</p>
                <p>And so, our big changes this year? Well, they have nothing to do with COVID and everything to do with our core mission as an organisation: <strong>helping people be active citizens</strong>.</p>
