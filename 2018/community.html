    <p class="limit-text"><strong>Valuable work</strong> In partnership with Power To Change, <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/2018/09/14/keep-it-in-the-community-a-snapshot-of-acvs-across-england/">we launched Keep It In The Community</a>, an England-wide map of every Asset of Community Value in the country. ACVs allow groups to preserve places and spaces that are valued by the community, but in danger of being lost to development</p>
    <p class="limit-text"><strong>Cyclical changes</strong> Funding from Merseyside Road Safety Partnership allowed us to <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/2018/09/19/collideoscope-improvements-ready-to-roll/">make some huge improvements to Collideoscope</a>, our site for logging cycling accidents and near misses.</p>
    <p class="limit-text"><strong>Integrating authorities</strong> Four new councils adopted FixMyStreet as their official fault reporting platform, which takes a little tinkering below the bonnet at both their end and ours: a warm welcome to <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/2018/06/08/fixmystreet-pro-meets-salesforce-integrated-street-reporting-for-rutland">Rutland</a>, <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/2018/04/16/two-new-fixmystreet-pro-councils/">Bucks & B&NES</a> ‚Äî and Lincolnshire, <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/2018/08/23/fixmystreet-for-lincolnshire-a-very-modern-way-of-working/">where all that tinkering was done remotely</a>.</p>

  <h2>FixMyStreet improvements</h2>
  <p class="limit-text"><strong>Red routes</strong> Now FixMyStreet knows if you report a problem on <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/2018/08/14/red-routes-on-fixmystreet/">a road that‚Äôs the responsibility of TfL</a> ‚Äî and sends it to them.</p> 
  <p class="limit-text"><strong>Highways the right way</strong> Equally, FixMyStreet now routes relevant motorway and A-road reports to Highways England.</p>
  <p class="limit-text"><strong>Men at work</strong> Selected councils can now <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/2018/08/13/when-theres-no-need-to-report-fixmystreet-and-roadworks-org/">show if roadworks are already scheduled</a> before people make a report.</p>
  <p class="limit-text"><strong>Easing congestion</strong> FixMyStreet maps were getting crowded, so we <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/2018/07/11/clearing-the-map/">thinned out the pins</a>.</p>
  <p class="limit-text"><strong>Seeing spots</strong> We can import councils‚Äô own ‚Äòasset‚Äô maps ‚Äî so you‚Äôll see individual trees, bins, streetlights, etc, <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/2018/04/18/seeing-spots-with-fixmystreet-pro/">all mapped on FixMyStreet</a>.</p>
