                <p>Welcome to our annual report. As always, it’s a chance to catch up with everything we’ve been doing in the last twelve months — and to take stock.</p>
                <p>We’ve been thinking deeply about what part mySociety has to play in the wider picture of global and national events. It’s been a heck of a year, with the shattering of democratic norms; the increasing grip of deep fakes, misdirection and misinformation; the growing recognition of climate tipping points, and failed promises from those in power.</p>
                <p>What gives us hope is that the tides have turned: the recognition that it is possible for ordinary people to hold power to account, to organise effectively for change, and to confront the challenges that lie ahead. Now, more than ever, it’s vital that every citizen feels empowered to act.</p>
                <p>And whether you're delighted or dismayed by the UK General Election result, one thing’s for sure: mySociety will go on providing the resolutely non-partisan services that we’re known for, through 2020 and beyond.
                We’ll help you hold your representatives to account, demand transparency and make change in your own neighbourhood.</p>
                <p>In short, we’ll be here to help you in every aspect of your life as an active citizen.</p>

        <p>More than <strong>3.5 million</strong> people used TheyWorkForYou to check out who their MP was, see how they voted and browse parliamentary debates.</p>
        <p>And over <strong>half a million</strong> folk used WritetoThem to send an email to their councillors, MPs, Assembly Members or MEPs.</p>

        <p>TheyWorkForYou and MapIt’s data helps others to create visualisations and conduct research, like this:</p>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm-4">
                <p>Parli-N-Grams, charting the frequency at which words and phrases are used in UK Parliament debates. Sometimes these are words which a certain Member of Parliament would prefer not to encounter.</p>

            <div class="col-sm-4">
                <p>Tactical voting advice was potentially useful — but what if every service advocates a different approach? Charles Owen tried to work it all out.</p>

            <div class="col-sm-4">
                <p>Voters could see and share electoral facts and margins at a glance thanks to these constituency cards.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>Countless news providers used TheyWorkForYou to underpin stories like these:</p>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm-4">
                <p>The New York Times linked to a TheyWorkForYou debate page in a story about Boris Johnson’s friendship with an entrepreneur who benefited from mayoral and governmental sponsorship.</p>

                <p>CarbonBrief used our data when analysing which MPs talk the most about climate change.</p>

            <div class="col-sm-4">
                <p>ForcesNetwork published a piece on the new defence minister’s voting record;  RightsInfo looked at the Tory leadership contenders in terms of their human rights stances; Pink News checked Jo Swinson’s voting records on gay rights when she became leaader of the Lib Dems,  and Country Life examined the new Environment minister’s record.</p>

        </div>

        <p>Many organisations used WriteToThem to help with campaigns, including: Extinction Rebellion, End Deportations, League Against Cruel Sports, Humanity and Inclusion, Where’s Your Head At, and both pro- and anti-Brexit campaigns.</p>

        <h2 class="text-center mt-6 mb-5">Birthday!</h2>
        <p>TheyWorkForYou turned 15 (that said, it displays the Hansard archive as far back as 1919).</p>

        <h2 class="text-center mt-6 mb-5">Who we worked with</h2>
        <p>We joined Westminster Foundation for Democracy in a visit to <strong>Uzbekistan’s Parliament</strong> in Tashkent, helping to analyse their current digital work, and making recommendations on how to open up their parliamentary processes digitally to increase citizen awareness and engagement.</p>
        <p>We successfully handed parliamentary monitoring sites <strong>the People's Assembly</strong> (South Africa) over to full local control and are ready to do the same with <strong>Mzalendo</strong> (Kenya), a great testament to the advanced capability of the civic tech sector in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

        <h2 class="text-center mt-6 mb-5">Where we said goodbye</h2>
        <p><a href="https://www.mysociety.org/2019/06/26/placing-everypolitician-on-hold/">Our active work on EveryPolitician comes to an end</a>, as our ability to continue the project without sufficient dedicated funding has diminished – we’ve lots to learn and share for other organisations about what we might do differently in the future.</p>

        <p>From zero carbon vehicles to fast and reliable public transport, here’s what the Greater Cambridge Citizens’ Assembly recommended.<p>
        <p>Some of the comments from those who contributed to the TheyWorkForYou crowdfunder were as cheering as the donations themselves!</p>
        <ul>
            <li>“My incumbent MP cited TheyWorkForYou as an indicator of his diligence, so he has responded positively to the pressure it puts on him. It works!”</li>
            <li>“This project has helped me decide who to vote for in the forthcoming election. Thank you!”</li>
            <li>“I've found this web site a wonderful resource for checking what MPs actually do as opposed to what they say.”</li>
            <li>“Being aware of the hard work my MP puts in keeps alive my trust in our parliament.”</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Thanks, everyone.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>We made recommendations around planning applications — specifically towards sharing open data.</li>

        <h2 class="text-center mt-6 mb-5">What people did with it</h2>
        <p>You made more than 387,000 FixMyStreet reports this year, either on FixMyStreet.com, via the app, or on one of the 22 council sites that use FixMyStreet Pro as their main reporting interface.</p>

        <h3>Saving money</h3>
        <p>Buckinghamshire County Council totted up the precise savings they’ve made since installing FixMyStreet Pro as their official reporting system. A 98.69% cut in costs? Now that’s impressive.</p>

        <h3>Saving the trees</h3>
        <p>Friends of the Earth recommended FixMyStreet as a way to protect local trees.</p>

        <h3>Fixing Grenada</h3>
        <p>A new site based on the FixMyStreet platform, for the “Island of Spice”.</p>

        <h2 class="text-center mt-6 mb-5">Who we worked with</h2>

        <h3>London just got more joined up</h3>
        <p>Thanks to our new partnership with TfL, there’s a whole new layer of connectivity on FixMyStreet for Greater London.</p>
        <p>Reports on the relevant bus stops, traffic lights, bus shelters, underground and overground stations are now routed direct to TFL to get them fixed.</p>

        <h3>Building our FixMyStreet Pro business</h3>
        <p>Running commercial services for local government means we can bring better, more efficient workflows to council staff and officers.</p>
        <p>The revenue also supports our charitable work, providing a significant and appropriate source of income.</p>
        <p>Over 6.5 million residents across several counties are enjoying easy street reporting direct from their councils’ websites, thanks to beautiful new FixMyStreet instances in…</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Northamptonshire</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Making our data more accessible</h3>
        <p>Working with folk from the University of Sheffield and University of Stirling, we decided how best to share FixMyStreet open data with researchers.</p>

                <p class="chat"><strong>Zarino</strong> It’s exciting to speak to a wide range of people, understand what works and doesn’t work about their current services, and come up with new solutions that hopefully make the world a better place.</p>
                <p class="chat"><strong>Chris</strong> After nearly six years working on mySociety’s democracy projects it was refreshing to (re)join the FixMyStreet team and get to work helping councils get set up with FixMyStreet Pro!</p>

        <p>Since we advocate for transparency, it’s only right that we practice it ourselves.</p>
        <p>So here’s where you can find, for 2018-19:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Our <a href="http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityWithPartB.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=1076346&SubsidiaryNumber=0">Charity Commission accounts</a>, including income and spending.</li>

            <li>Our <a href="https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/05798215">mySociety Ltd accounts on Companies House</a>. mySociety Ltd is the private limited company, wholly-owned by UKCOD, through which we carry out our commercial work.</li>
            <li>In 2018 we employed on average xx permanent staff and x staff on fixed term contracts, each of whom were paid in excess of the living wage.</li>
            <li>Salary costs are split across our Charity and Commercial companies, based on what projects staff spend their time on.</li>
            <li>Our Trustees and Non-Executive Directors all give their very valuable time for free and receive no other compensation — for which we’re very grateful.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-center mt-6 mb-5">What’s on the horizon?</h2>
        <p>We’re actively and enthusiastically working towards <strong>cutting our carbon emissions</strong>, looking at how we can cut down or mitigate our travel, use the most responsible suppliers, and help those who attend our events to keep their impact on the environment low low low. More on all of that soon.</p>
        <p>2020 will be <strong>the year of the climate crisis</strong> and like all organisations and individuals in our position we’ll be turning our focus towards what we can do to help mitigate the worst. Expect to see us adapt our existing transparency and democracy work towards this goal, with the creation of a new initiative or two directly targeting the main contributors to the crisis.</p>
