                <p><strong>It’s been a year like no other.</strong></p>
                <p>2020: pandemics and political shenanigans, lockdowns and leaving &mdash; this is a year that no one is going to forget in a hurry.</p>
                <p>So whilst all the tumult of this year won’t come as a surprise to anyone, fortunately for us, mySociety’s Annual Report comes out before everyone else’s, so we can get in first with the commentary and a few clichés.</p>
                <p>In many ways we have been fortunate. We’ve experienced little operational disturbance, since we’ve always been a remote organisation where everyone works from home. But with travel disallowed and face to face meetings largely a thing of the past, there was nonetheless some disruption. It all began for us with the swift reorganisation of our TICTeC conference: we’d planned to convene in Reykjavik in March; instead we found ourselves running one of the first conferences this year to go online.</p>
                <p>With all that 2020 brought, we kept on keeping on. We renamed our businesses, re-emphasising the importance of that little thing called ‘society’ along the way; we launched many new projects and supported hundreds of individuals and organisations to make use of our services &mdash; many of which you’ll read about in this report.</p>
                <p>Our major theme for 2020? Mostly it’s been about preparing for the years ahead. Read on to see how we’re getting ready to face a new series of challenges, to play our small but crucial part in helping the world to take on the difficult path that lies before us.</p>

            <blockquote style="max-width: 960px;" class="mx-auto mb-4 h4 text-white">“TICTeC worked well as a virtual conference because you felt like everyone involved was ‘in the room’ and participating. It was the closest I’ve come to having an online event ‘feel’ like a real life event.”</blockquote>
            <p>Other notable TICTeC sessions included <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eFA00RJMa4&feature=youtu.be" class="white-link">Civic Hall presenting</a> their latest research on how organisations have managed to survive, and even thrive, in the difficult field of civic engagement, social change, and the digital transformation of democracy.</p>
            <p>These examples, and the others we heard at TICTeC 2020, are just the kind of evidence-based impact and research stories we love to hear at TICTeC events, to inform the future development of civic technology.</p>
