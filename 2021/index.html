                <p><strong>It’s been a year like no other.</strong></p>
                <p>2020: pandemics and political shenanigans, lockdowns and leaving &mdash; this is a year that no one is going to forget in a hurry.</p>
                <p>So whilst all the tumult of this year won’t come as a surprise to anyone, fortunately for us, mySociety’s Annual Report comes out before everyone else’s, so we can get in first with the commentary and a few clichés.</p>
                <p>In many ways we have been fortunate. We’ve experienced little operational disturbance, since we’ve always been a remote organisation where everyone works from home. But with travel disallowed and face to face meetings largely a thing of the past, there was nonetheless some disruption. It all began for us with the swift reorganisation of our TICTeC conference: we’d planned to convene in Reykjavik in March; instead we found ourselves running one of the first conferences this year to go online.</p>
                <p>With all that 2020 brought, we kept on keeping on. We renamed our businesses, re-emphasising the importance of that little thing called ‘society’ along the way; we launched many new projects and supported hundreds of individuals and organisations to make use of our services &mdash; many of which you’ll read about in this report.</p>
                <p>Our major theme for 2020? Mostly it’s been about preparing for the years ahead. Read on to see how we’re getting ready to face a new series of challenges, to play our small but crucial part in helping the world to take on the difficult path that lies before us.</p>

                <p class="chat">Giving oral evidence to the Lords Committee on Digital Democracy back in March was quite
                    rewarding, as was seeing many of our recommendations included in the final report. Digital democracy
                    is kind of our thing, so it is always good to have that recognised by the people who govern us!</p>
                <p class="chat">As a designer, it was fascinating to see how another country’s parliament works &mdash; and the challenges faced by MPs and their staff, in representing a citizenry with completely different economic and technological challenges.</p>
                <p class="chat">Work we did with the Moroccan parliament demonstrated that citizens there preferred some of the changes made as a result of COVID-19, especially the move to broadcast sessions on TV.</p>
                <p class="chat">This has enabled citizens to inform themselves and better hold their parliamentarians to
                        account, and we have recommended that these broadcasts are continued beyond the pandemic.</p>

            <blockquote style="max-width: 960px;" class="mx-auto mb-4 h4 text-white">“TICTeC worked well as a virtual conference because you felt like everyone involved was ‘in the room’ and participating. It was the closest I’ve come to having an online event ‘feel’ like a real life event.”</blockquote>
            <p>Other notable TICTeC sessions included <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eFA00RJMa4&feature=youtu.be" class="white-link">Civic Hall presenting</a> their latest research on how organisations have managed to survive, and even thrive, in the difficult field of civic engagement, social change, and the digital transformation of democracy.</p>
            <p>These examples, and the others we heard at TICTeC 2020, are just the kind of evidence-based impact and research stories we love to hear at TICTeC events, to inform the future development of civic technology.</p>

                <p>The past couple of years for us at mySociety have all been about consolidation and improvement. Making sure we’re working on the right things that actually help people dig into the challenges our sites and services aim to solve.</p>
                <p>As we wrap up this year we’re in the midst of a full on strategy review, thinking carefully about the challenges that lie ahead for society and where we might make the most significant contribution. We need to continue to increase our impact especially for marginalised communities and engage in more cross-functional collaboration to make things better.</p>
                <p>Amidst the pandemic our focus on the climate took some buffeting, but the useful foundations we’ve established this year set us up well for the rapid and determined support of communities across the UK and beyond, to get ready for the changes they’ll need to lead on. </p>
                <p>Whilst the political and cultural impact of the last couple of years means we are refocused on the UK more than ever, our commitment to supporting our unique network of FOI services in dozens of countries remains undiminished. And the smart folks in our research team have proven that not being able to travel hasn’t held them back too much from helping a range of parliaments around the world to work out this whole digital democracy thing.</p>
                <p>In 2021 we might even get to see each other in person again. Until then we’ll be making sure we bring new ideas and inspiration via online TICTeC activities throughout the year.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, stay safe, take care of each other and let’s see what kind of society we can build together.</p>
