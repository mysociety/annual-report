                <p><strong>It’s been a year like no other.</strong></p>
                <p>2020: pandemics and political shenanigans, lockdowns and leaving &mdash; this is a year that no one is going to forget in a hurry.</p>
                <p>So whilst all the tumult of this year won’t come as a surprise to anyone, fortunately for us, mySociety’s Annual Report comes out before everyone else’s, so we can get in first with the commentary and a few clichés.</p>
                <p>In many ways we have been fortunate. We’ve experienced little operational disturbance, since we’ve always been a remote organisation where everyone works from home. But with travel disallowed and face to face meetings largely a thing of the past, there was nonetheless some disruption. It all began for us with the swift reorganisation of our TICTeC conference: we’d planned to convene in Reykjavik in March; instead we found ourselves running one of the first conferences this year to go online.</p>
                <p>With all that 2020 brought, we kept on keeping on. We renamed our businesses, re-emphasising the importance of that little thing called ‘society’ along the way; we launched many new projects and supported hundreds of individuals and organisations to make use of our services &mdash; many of which you’ll read about in this report.</p>
                <p>Our major theme for 2020? Mostly it’s been about preparing for the years ahead. Read on to see how we’re getting ready to face a new series of challenges, to play our small but crucial part in helping the world to take on the difficult path that lies before us.</p>
